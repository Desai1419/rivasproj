            <h1>THE DRAGONBORN</h1>
            <p>A Dragonborn, (Dragon Language: DOVAhKIiN Dovahkiin, which can mean both "dragon-born" and "dragonkind-hunter-born"), is a rare individual who has been born with the blood and soul of a dragon, but the body of a mortal.[1] They can naturally learn and speak the ancient and powerful tongue of the Dov, called the Thu'um.[2]

Dragonborn scarcely exist, and it is rare for more than one to appear at the same time.[2] They can belong to any race or gender, and the dragon blood (transliterated from DOVAhSOS to Dovah Sos) is a gift bestowed to certain mortals favored by Akatosh. Despite their divine souls, Dragonborn possess a mortal free will and may serve as champions for either the Nine Divines or the Daedric Princes. It is unknown if the Daedra claim the souls of their Dragonborn champions as they do with their other servants. Their mortal bodies also subject them to mortal vulnerabilities; old age, death, and disease all affect Dragonborn as they do common mortals.

Some Dragonborn individuals have knowledge of the Thu'um and can consume a slain dragon's soul and absorb its knowledge directly, allowing them to learn Words of Power instantaneously, and then use the power of a slain dragon's soul to unlock that Shout.[2] It is said that the Blades have always guided, protected, and served the Dragonborn, whom they consider "The Ultimate Dragon Slayer."[3] The Greybeards, however, see the Blades as ambitious assassins who seek to mold the Dragonborn into a weapon for their own ends.</p>
